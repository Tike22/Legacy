1.	How many recipients of certificates of freedom ALSO had a manumission record?
import pandas as pd
h = pd.read_csv('CertificatesofFreedom.csv', low_memory=False)
h['full_name'] = h['Freed_FirstName'] + " " + h['Freed_LastName'].dropna()
t = pd.read_csv("Manumissions.csv", low_memory=False)
t['full_name'] = t['Slave_FirstName'] + " " + t['Slave_LastName']

j = h['full_name'].dropna()
b = []
for name in j:
    b.append(name)
#print(b)

count = 0
for full in t['full_name']:
    if full in b:
        count += 1
        print(full)
print(count)

2.	How many African Americans were free born vs enslaved, according to their certificate of freedom?  #Tamia will do graph
# Code for African Americans that were enslaved
cert_cat = h[["Freed_FirstName", "Freed_LastName","PriorStatus"]]
lower_ensl = pd.DataFrame(cert_cat['PriorStatus'].str.lower())
lower_ensl['PriorStatus'].replace(to_replace=['slave'],value='enslaved',inplace=True)
loc_ensl = lower_ensl.loc[lower_ensl['PriorStatus'] == "enslaved"]
a=len(loc_ensl)
a

#Put code below in a new cell
#Code for African Americans that were Free Born
pd.set_option('mode.chained_assignment',None)
lower_fb = pd.DataFrame(cert_cat['PriorStatus'].str.lower())
lower_fb['PriorStatus'].replace(to_replace=['born free'],value='free born',inplace=True)
loc_free = lower_fb.loc[lower_fb['PriorStatus'] == "free born"]
b=len(loc_free)
b

3.	Which county recorded the most certificates of freedom? What were the names of the clerks that did the recording?
county = h['County'].value_counts()
county

4.	What were the different age ranges of the slaves?
