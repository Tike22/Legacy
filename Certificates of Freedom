1.	How many recipients of certificates of freedom ALSO had a manumission record?
import pandas as pd
h = pd.read_csv('CertificatesofFreedom.csv', low_memory=False)
h['full_name'] = h['Freed_FirstName'] + " " + h['Freed_LastName'].dropna()
t = pd.read_csv("Manumissions.csv", low_memory=False)
t['full_name'] = t['Slave_FirstName'] + " " + t['Slave_LastName']

j = h['full_name'].dropna()
b = []
for name in j:
    b.append(name)
#print(b)

count = 0
for full in t['full_name']:
    if full in b:
        count += 1
        print(full)
print(count)

2.	How many African Americans were free born vs enslaved, according to their certificate of freedom?
# Code for African Americans that were enslaves
import pandas as pd
cert_free = pd.read_csv('Certificates of Freedom.csv')
a=cert_free.dtypes
cert_cat = cert_free[["Freed_FirstName", "Freed_LastName","PriorStatus"]]
loc_ensl = cert_cat.loc[cert_cat['PriorStatus'] == "Enslaved"]
a=len(loc_ensl)
a

#Code for African Americans that were Free Born
loc_free = cert_cat.loc[cert_cat['PriorStatus'] == "Free born"]
b=len(loc_free)
b
