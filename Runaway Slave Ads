1.	What newspaper contained the most runaway ads?
import pandas as pd
runa = pd.read_csv('Runaway Slaves.csv')
runa1 = runa['Source'].value_counts()
runa1.head()

2. What year and month had the most runaway ads found?
import pandas as pd
pd = pd.read_csv('RunawaySlaveAds.csv')
f = pd['ad_date']
f = f.dropna()

g = {}
for ad in f:
    ad = ad[:-2]
    if ad not in g:
        g[ad] = 1
    else:
        g[ad] += 1

l = list()
for key, val in g.items():
    l.append((val,key))

l.sort(reverse = True)

print( l[1][1][0:4], l[1][1][4:6])

3.	What are the ranges of ages of those mentioned?
import pandas as pd

m = pd.read_csv('RunawaySlaveAds.csv')
m = m['fugative_age']
m = m.dropna()

y =[]
for e in d:
    if len(e) > 2: continue
    elif len(e) < 1: continue
    elif e == " ": continue
    else:
        e = int(e)
        y.append(e)
print(max(y))
print(min(y))

4.	What are the ranges of rewards noted? Can we line up these values with a type or specific characteristic of enslaved laborer that was highly valued?
o = pd.read_csv('RunawaySlaveAds.csv')

v = o['reward_amount'].dropna()
g = []
for num in v:
    if num.isdigit():
        g.append(int(num))
print(sorted(g)[1]) 
print(sorted(g)[-1])

5.	How many ads mention a family member or location where family may have lived?
# Display of Ads
fug_cata = runa[["fugative_destination","destination_catagory", "destination_justification"]]
drop = fug_cata.dropna()
loc_fam = drop.loc[drop['destination_catagory'] == "family"]
loc_fam



#Put code below in a new cell
#Count Ads
runa5=loc_fam.memory_usage()
runa5
